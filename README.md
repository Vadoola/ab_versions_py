This library is getting the version number and locked/protected status from file generated by Rockwell Software FactoryTalk View.

Right now it can get the version number from MER and APA files generated by FactoryTalk View ME, as well as tell you if they are locked, and strip the protection.

It might work on APA files generated from FactoryTalk View SE, but I have not tested this or looked into it.
At some point I plan on testing that, as well as adding some support for other Allen Bradley / Rockwell Software file formats, such as the newer APB files from FactoryTalk View SE.

This library is simply python bindings to the main library written in Rust which can be found [here](https://github.com/Vadoola/ab_versions_rs)
